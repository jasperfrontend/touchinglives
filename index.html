                            <p><em>Cornelis was finally able to succesfully communicate with the parents of his daughter's friend</em></p>
                            <iframe width="100%" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q3VNu4OabCE?controls=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                            <p>I visited a Syrian refugee living in my town. His name is Abdul and he’s the father of two children who go to the same school as my children. He barely speaks Dutch and no English and I really wanted to get in touch with him, to get connected, hear his story and to see if I could help him. Well, I now can tell from my very own experience that the device really does make a difference.</p>

                            <p>At first, the meeting was a bit awkward, with me sitting on his couch, trying to talk through a device. He clearly didn’t feel at ease. But after 15 mins or so, we got used to communicating using the Travis, and then he began to tell his story, why he escaped Syria, what he has seen (and what his oldest daughter has seen), and how they’re doing now. I was really touched and very happy to be able to really get to the heart of matters.</p>

                            <p>Later on he asked my to help with some documentation, and again with help from Travis, I could. It was very good for me to experience this myself.</p>

                            <p>I went to Italy for my great auntie's 50th wedding anniversary. I have visited her and her husband before, but I always stay with my cousin who speaks English.</p>
                            <p>I can say simple things to my great auntie, how are you and talking about food mostly. This year I took Travis and we were able to really talk! She told me a few stories about my grandfather (her brother) whom I had never met. He left Italy after WW2 and never travelled back. She only heard about his life in Australia from me and it was so incredible to finally be able to understand her questions and to share stories. I found out a lot more about him and my Italian heritage than I expected.</p>

                            <p>John brought Travis to his work to speak with many foreign people coming in. His colleague was very excited with it and went around at work "playing" with it. He came back after a while and told John: "hey guess what I discovered, the Polish guy, the heating in his room is not working." The poor fella has been there for several days without heating, never communicated it. Moral of story, people with language barriers often "suffer in silence". Having Travis around opens up things you never knew before.</p>

                            <p>Based on recommendations we (me and 2 friends) went to a bar in Tokyo. We received the drinks menu and everything was in Japanse, we asked the bartender but she only spoke a litte English: A shame because they had all kinds of beer specials. But we had Travis! The bartender was able to explain us about the infused beer and the origin - for at least 5 minutes! She loved it as well!</p>

                            <p><em>Are you single or married?</em></p>
                            <p>In Tokyo, I was having lunch at the sushi bar counter. Next to me were 2 ladies mother & daughter having a lunch mother-daughter catch up. After a while, I decided to initiate a conversation using Travis. They were surprised / shocked. The daughter understood quite fast that she can use the device to ask me questions. And there we were going back and forth with it. Soon, we were joking about the sushi chef. It seems they are regulars and the sushi chef always makes jokes at their expense (teasingly).</p>
                            <p>So now it's her chance to make jokes about the chef. As you can see it's just random chatting, and it's possible with Travis!!! The mom was more hesitant at first, preferring to ask her daughter to ask me questions. But as we laughed more and more, mom couldn't resist and finally picked up Travis herself and asked a question:</p>

                            <p>"Are you single or married?", and I replied "Neither single nor married. It's complicated." mom was impressed she could understand me and she went "ohhhhhhh" we laughed more and then started to buy each other drinks. While this is not a story of "heartwarming" impact, it's a light hearted version. It's the first time I've had a conversation with Japanese "strangers" who don't speak English - it was fun, and it's possible with Travis.</p>

                            <p>Angela works in Hostel Room Rotterdam and daily she meets travelers from all over the world. Andrea from Peru was staying in the hostel for almost 2 months. She had no idea what was his story because he speaks only Spanish and she doesnt. She was curious but unable to ask. One day she was working together with a collegue who has Travis translator. When Andrea approached the reception and said something in Spanish, she borrowed the Travis translator. Surprised by how easy it was to use it, they managed to understand each other. She booked him another night and also asked what brings him here to Rotterdam. Turns our business! They bothe were happy about this moment of connection. </p>

                            <p><em>The story of a young Hungarian boy with a rather troublesome background who is pretty torn between the worlds.</em></p>
                            <p>"My current &ldquo;project&rdquo; is a young Hungarian boy with a rather troublesome background and he is pretty torn between the worlds.
                            English is easy to learn and it’s also a pretty tolerant language when it comes to how to use grammar correctly when speaking to each other.
                            German and Hungarian are the total opposite in this regard.</p>

                            <p>In German, if you only got one word wrong, the whole sentence sounds weird for a native speaker, which makes it extremely difficult to get really fluent.
                            Hungarians on the other hand have a very strange system of building sentences – it’s on 5th place of the most difficult languages to learn, I think.
                            So besides his personal problems, I have a boy who left Hungary at 9 (so he didn’t learn Hungarian properly), came to Germany, did some language courses in elementary school (together with immigrants from about 10 other mostly Arabic and African countries – which was really “useful”) and now in comprehensive school he’s got English on top. Therefore, now at 12, he has three languages he cannot speak and write properly – this is quite a challenge I can tell you.
                            The Travis device is welcomed here as a fast and mostly reliable thing to get words and phrases translated quickly."</p>
